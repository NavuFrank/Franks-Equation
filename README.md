# Frank's Equation: Cognitectural Dimenscape

A deterministic geometric-cryptographic framework that generates unique, infinitely complex 3-D structures from a 4-D tesseract.

## What is Frank's Equation?

### Simple Explanation (Non-Mathematical)

Imagine a 4-dimensional cube perfectly hovering in 3D space (X, Y, Z axes). Now imagine time stretches infinitely as a fourth dimension. 

As time extends to infinity, the 4D cube automatically subdivides into smaller and smaller 3D cubes—eight at each step. The angles and vertices multiply endlessly, becoming so tiny they eventually enter the quantum level... but never stop growing.

This is the **Cognitectural Dimenscape**—a unique geometric structure so complex that:
- **No two are identical** (each seed produces a different one)
- **No one can copy it** without the original seed
- **It's too complex to understand** without mathematics
- **It grows forever** toward infinity

The equation \(F_n = (C_n, A_n, S_n)\) is the mathematical code that explains how this happens.

### Why "Frank's Equation"?

This work was inspired by Anne Frank's diary, which moved me deeply. The concept emerged at 4 AM on December 4, 2025, combining geometry, cryptography, and the power of infinite complexity.


## Technical Overview

**Fn = (Cn, An, Sn)**

Where:
- **Cn** = Set of 3-D cubes after n subdivisions
- **An** = Number of distinct dihedral angles
- **sn** = Cryptographic hash value (seed-based)
